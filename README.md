# Pro-AD-Pelo
Pro-AD-Pelo is an advertising and transaction overview system for hair style appointments in New York City

Small businesses such as hair style locations are in need of a transaction overview system to use scope margins available for profit in NYC and of advertisement to increase customer volume

Transaction is of interest to PERCEPT CONNECT not just for dollar value but for the trait sequence which continues and is advertised with the service & product

A hair style transaction creates emotional & internal connection with external world by image and language
ie: person talks to express how they wish to perceive themselves and receives satisfaction with image in mirror

As a psych student I have observed the value in tracking emotional interaction and sequence following purchases

Emotions, theme or nutritional supplements provided and advertised to and by small businesses can be tracked as a sample for the greater purpose of PERCEPT CONNECT which is to understand the development of thought processes as transactions are performed at common intersections or encounters such as the hair style transaction

The purpose of tracking the behavior of users and service providers is to enable them to learn the proper emotional sequences needed for continuous business to increment through trait relation.

The platform is to run javascript and objective C to the user and service provider. Advertisement is to run simultaneously using python to phish net social media users within a given mile radius to book appointments during school or work hours to increase volume of transactions

ie: character progression out of these perspectives allows for productive personality increment

The behavior or emotional sequence started at Transaction is to create new tendencies at located in-stances in between style appointments to serve for further relation
ie: Trait sequence after transaction is to continue kines perception as subscribed to in content and out of style chair
